  <!--there are quite a different few meta elements,this particular one
 is called character set. We are setting the character set to "utf-8". Well
the meta element gives extra meta data or associated metadata to our
html document. In this case we are telling the browser that when it opens
this file, all the text inside our webpage is encoded using the utf-8 encoding
system. You can google the characters in utf-8.
the other thing is unicode includes emojis to your site from
https://unicode-table.com/. so everythingthat is unicode can be coded correctly
using utf-8. So the metadata gives yourwebsite the maximum chance of being
rendered correctly from browsers originating from international visitors-->

So search engines look for the meta tags with attribute description so
as to display that description when a search related to your site is made

  <!--If you cant get an image of yourself online,you may open an account on
photobucket and upload your images there so that you can get a url for your image.
You may also store the image locally in your sites folder-->
  <!--The image tag is a self closing tag and a tag only is not sufficient
  ww need to specify the source,so that can either be a url or a local image
  included in the same directory as your website. The 'alt' attribute acts
  as an alternative to your image if the image doest pop up, so it can be text.
  It can also be used to describe what that text image is about, so if you are
  intrested in SEO and getting your website ranking for certain keywords, this
  is something that google looks at to try and figure out what your webpage
  is about. So if you are making a webpage about barito recipes and you add an
  'alt' text that says 'finished barito product image-1' then it helps google
  to index and figure out that maybe your webpage is related when somebody is
  searching for barito recipes-->

<!--The general structure of a table formating is as below
<table>
  </thead>
  Inside the table head we can add some titles to each of our columns and make
  it formatted by default in bold. thus we will add a new table row <tr></tr>
  and inside table row we will create a table header cell element instead of
  table data or td elements i.e <th></th>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
  </tbody>

  <tfoot>
  </tfoot>
</table>

the reason why we've put table header, body and footer separately is we want
to isolate the different parts of the table inorder to stlye it differently or
make it function in a different way. Although declaring the header cell elements
in the table element outside the head will achieve the same function but that
will not allow us to isolate the different parts of the table depending on
how we want to stle it">
NB deprecated means something nolonger recomended to be used.
